#TODO:
# There are a bunch of things one can add to this script:
# 1-Plot nDCC maps or normalized linear mutual information maps!: Done!
# 2-Project (high) correlations onto PDB structure.
#   a) as a Pymol script output: Done
#   b) as a VMD script output: Done!
# 3-Project secondary structures on x and y axes of a correlation map.
# 4-Difference maps: Done!
# 5-Combining two correlation plots as upper triangle and lower triangle.
# 6-Filter correlations lower than a certain (absolute) value.: Done!
# 7-Filter correlations for residues that are very close.: Done!
# 8-Add centrality calculations: Done
# 9-Add centrality visualizations: Done
# 10-Time lagged correlation analysis for MD trajectories:
# 11-Time shifted correlation analysis. For example, shift 100 frames each time
#    to do centrality or community analysis.
# 12-Better pruning functions to clean correlation maps.
# 13-A new utilities module to add, subtract, average, triangulate the correlation 
#    maps. Some of the currently available functionalities can be moved there.
# 14-A better way to run tests more systematically.
# 15-Move to argparse instead of getopt.

Example usage:

correlationplus -h

CorrelationPlus contains five apps:
 - calculate
 - visualize
 - analyze
 - paths
 - diffMap

You can get more information about each individual app as follows:
